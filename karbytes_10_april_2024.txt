karbytes_0: "I decided that, in KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10, I will strive to only focus on engineering-oriented subject matter to the exclusion of social justice matters such as racism and sexism."

karbytes_1: "Then people will assume that you being white supremacist and sexist in favor of males (because the subject matter you want to focus on in this chapter is considered by many people to be exclusive towards non-white people and women)."

karbytes_0: "I disagree that the subject matter which I want to focus on in this chapter is favorist towards any particular race or gender or that such subject matter is not something non-white people or women are able to participate and even excel in."

karbytes_1: "Many people would insist otherwise. Therefore, you might want to make your content more deliberately and explicitly inclusive and appealing towards such racial and gender minorities. That way, you are likely to get more readership and community support and less hostility and censorship attempts directed at you by people other than yourself."

karbytes_0: "Even though I might inspire fewer people to read my content and more people to try to sabotage my efforts to further my blog's development and preservation if I go against what you advised, I value TRUTH very highly and hence prefer to make investigating how nature works beyond the scope of human culture (using logic, technology (especially computers), and rigorous investigation of empirical phenomena) the primary focus of my blog (in addition to showcasing timelessly appealing software applications I create which explore subjects I find interesting and relevant in the subjects of mathematics and physics)."

karbytes_1: "Many people are opposed to you showing off your intellect (especially building those software applications). That is because such people tend to have less free time than you have to study and become as well versed in scientifically and technologically rigorous domains as you are and aspire to be. Such people think that it is unfair (and injust) for you to be allowed to pursue your website development projects without their constant interference so that you do not advance faster and further than they are comfortable with (because they need to hold you back in order to catch up to you)."

karbytes_0: "The mentality you described sounds like what I think is at the core of what is wrong with humanity at this time. Too may humans seem to be too underdeveloped in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to be able to think on a systems level instead of merely at a primitive animalistic tribal level where emotional impulses instead of solution-finding logic seem to reign supreme and on a large-scale level. What I mean to say is that society has conditioned people to reinforce addicting and simultaneously oppressive norms which seem to prevent those people from doing little other than cleaning up the same types of messes ad infinitum and having babies (which are ultimately used as human trafficking victims). After sufficiently many cycles of such feverish madness, the human species will likely go extinct due to warfare and environmental toxicity and destabilization. This is not a social justice matter. This is an engineering problem for smart and motivated people to attempt to solve given what they have. I do not want to help humanity procrastinate on saving itself from its own self-inflicted demise. I am not interested in congratulating humans on doing the bare minimum required of them by their society in terms of survival and getting appraisal from their fellow humans. I am frankly not at all impressed by how lazy, mean, cowardly, and unintelligent seemingly most humans are. They do not have to like me nor read my content. Unlike many of them, I do not deliberately try to upset people or to prevent them from enjoying their lives (unless what they are doing is directly and immediately putting me in physical harm's way or equivalent to them vandalizing my property)."

karbytes_1: "You sound like a misanthrope."

karbytes_0: "I do not consider myself to particularly love nor hate humanity. I just feel the need to avoid most of them because many of them go out of their way to sabotage micromanage what I am trying to do. They seem to have at least as much free time and money as I have (yet they still nevertheless seem hellbent on trying to control me instead of on minding their own business while not trying to control people other than themselves). Frankly, I think that some of the biggest oppressors of racial and gender minorities are members of those so-called marginalized populations. I think they would rather play victim and force others to do the same than level up their caliber of thinking and conduct because they are depressed and addicted to all the social perks of being mentally ill. It's easier to be a depressed and hate-spewing bum than a tenaciously optimistic problem solver like me."

karbytes_1: "You're such a braggart (and so not humble)!"

karbytes_0: "Yeah, I know. At least I have something to be genuinely proud of myself for. At least I don't get off on trying to cripple or imprison others."

karbytes_1: "You think people other than yourself are horrible; don't you?"

karbytes_0: "Eh, it's a mixed bag (the human population). I think more than ninety percent of them live and think like animals and that fewer than ten percent of them seriously behave and think like engineers attempting to seriously help solve global and even local problems. I do have faith that the future-minded and solution-finding minority will help human civilization survive and thrive for many millenia to come (and they will do their work with or without social appraisal and financial compensation)."

karbytes: "It's time to go. We have to wrap this conversation up now so that we can move on to the next part of our projects as efficiently as possible. We are officially done with the subject of social justice. We will now constrain our focus to science, technology, and metaphysics only (and personal logistics matters only as minimally as we deem necessary)."
