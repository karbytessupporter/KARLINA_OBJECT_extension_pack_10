In hindsight, I could just as easily say that people will not improve their conduct unless they are in enough pain to be coerced into changing.

On 10_APRIL_2024 at approximately 4:30PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes deleted the karbytes-created tweet reply and the corresponding karbytes-created tweet mentioned in the previous two sections of this note from karbytes' Twitter dot Com page (and karbytes deleted the social media post depicting a screenshot of that tweet from karbytes' Minds dot Com page, from karbytes' LinkedIn dot Com page, and from karbytes' Patreon dot Com page).

On 10_APRIL_2024 at approximately 9:00PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes deleted the karbytes-created tweet reply to a tweet which someone other than karbytes created. karbytes also unliked that tweet (because karbytes thinks that a human individual's value to any human other than itself is conditionally based on the degree of utilitarian usefulness that human provides to that human other than itself).

Fear of AI overtaking jobs misses the point. The real question is why so many of us tied human value to labor

tweet_reply_text:

Good question! My answer is that humans are not yet prepared to find meaning in their lives outside of the soon-to-be-obsolete roles they have complacently resigned themselves to. Change is uncomfortable and hence vehemently resisted by such humans. Change is an acquired taste.
