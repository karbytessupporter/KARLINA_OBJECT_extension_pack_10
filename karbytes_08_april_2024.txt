In particular, one of those two discs (which contains exactly one folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0) contains the following (unintentionally added by karbytes) extraneous files: one outdated file named KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG-main_20april2024.zip and two non-identical and outdated versions of the file named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9-main.zip.

The other one of those two discs (which contains exactly one folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_0) contains the following (unintentionally added by karbytes) extraneous files: the same two aforementioned non-identical and outdated versions of the file named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9-main.zip.
