This note is a follow-up to the previous note I wrote (which has been published as a web page named BEING_OTHER_THAN_MERELY_HUMAN)...

karbytes_0: "Not every person is necessarily capable of being happy regardless of how hard they try to be. Some people might be relegated to circumstances which physically prevent them from feeling sufficient pleasure and from feeling insufficient blunting of pain to derive genuine satisfaction from their experiences. Also, some people might not be able to form new memories, some people might not be able to retrieve old memories, and some people might not be able to formulate thoughts which are coherent or complex enough to generate a sense of intellectual achievement. Whether such beings are merely hypothetical or actual exist is not important in this conversation. What is important in this conversation is you acknowledging that it might not always be possible for every person to generate happiness or a sense of accomplishment by their own efforts. You therefore should update your worldview or ideology to accommodate such possibilities."

karbytes_1: "Okay. I acknowledge that it might not always be possible for every person to attain happiness and that it might not always be possible for every person to achieve their goals or even to make progress towards achieving their goals. I understand that what I might have insinuated is a bit elitist and ablist. Are you suggesting I just conclude that such people are doomed to be miserable?"

karbytes_0: "Not necessarily. Some of them might be miserable. Some of them might not be miserable. What I am trying to get you to acknowledge is that not every person is necessarily as happy as you are or aspire to be or think any people other than yourself ought to be."

karbytes_2: "I don't mean to intrude upon your conversation but I thought you two should be warned about some news I heard about karbytes a few hours ago: karbytes supposedly is being prevented from being gainfully employed such that karbytes is doomed to never have enough money consistently to pay for karbytes' lifestyle expenses without having to rely on financial assistance from other people or to simply go without many of the lifestyle items and practices karbytes deems to be essential to karbytes' happiness. Also, any people karbytes depends on for financial assistance is legally able to reduce the amount of money they give to karbytes and even to stop giving karbytes money. I heard that the people karbytes currently depends on for nearly 100% of karbytes' money is prone to being psychologically abusive and controlling in how they interact with karbytes to the extent that people  expressed concern that karbytes is going to get cut off of financial support before karbytes gets a job. If that is the case, then karbytes is likely going to have to stop working on karbytes' website building activities and other so-called recreational pursuits in order to focus on purely rudimentary survival-oriented activities and because karbytes will not be able to afford replacing lost, stolen, or damaged equipment nor pay bills. In such a case, karbytes would likely have to go to homeless shelters for food and little else (because, based on what I heard, the society karbytes lives in does not offer much in the way of employment placement, permanent housing assistance, and many other things which most people would consider to be essential prerequisites to having secured prior to getting and keeping a job)."

karbytes_0: "Even if karbytes ends up getting cut off of financial support or having to postpone its hobbies for an indefinitely long time, karbytes did get to enjoy more free time and opportunity to partake in its hobbies and in developing its websites than what most people in karbytes' society have ever thus far. Hence, unlike most people who end up financially destitute or homeless (or even severely crippled, imprisoned, kidnapped, enslaved, or brutally tortured), karbytes had gotten to enjoy a relatively long and prosperous life as a website developer and consciousness researcher with a world-class and free-style education post high school. Hence, we should not be too dismayed if karbytes ends up undergoing any of the adversity I enumerated in this paragraph. What we should acknowledge is the many less fortunate humans who comprise the majority of human civilization at this time and prior to this time. Many of them are pessimistic about the future of humanity and think that human civilization will end as a result of human-caused environmental degradation or human-caused warfare (or from some other disaster which may or may not be human caused)."

karbytes_1: "Yes, and let me add to that the very important fact that smart, rich, and politically powerful individuals are working tirelessly on providing tangible and viable solutions to the problems which concern humanity as a whole though those pessimistic 'working class' and/or 'disabled' poor people might not have the patience nor the foresight to currently believe that such solutions are going to be provided to them before some horrific apocalypse arrives. Such people would rather just throw tantrums and do the bare minimum to stay alive one hour at a time without much long-term planning because such people believe it's already too late to stop the apocalypse from happening. Such people hate when people like karbytes gloat and preach about a more utopian future because such people think karbytes is naive, arrogant, and lacking in empathy for such people. I have been told many times that karbytes needs to stop being such a staunch evangelical about futurist or environment-sustainability topics and, instead, be more quiet, meek, humble, embittered, downtrodden, down-to-earth, gregarious, and people-pleasing in order to be more like those poor (and majority) of people in karbytes' society (instead of acting like some comparatively rich, educated, and elitist snob)."

karbytes_0: "karbytes is hooked up to a lie detector apparatus at all times. It is therefore futile for karbytes to attempt to lie that karbytes is not an elitist snob who thinks that all the majority of humans need to do is try not to hurt themselves and each other while the visionaries and engineers work on developing and delivering the solutions society needs to keep going for at least another ten thousand years."

karbytes_2: "Good luck, karbytes! I hope you avoid getting into trouble and, instead, help create and promote solutions to the problems you and your society are facing."
