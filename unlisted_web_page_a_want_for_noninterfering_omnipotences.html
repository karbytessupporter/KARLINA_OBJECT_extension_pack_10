<p>As irrational as this might sound, I have seriously wondered whether or not the universe which I appear to myself (and to humans other than myself (who also appear to be living inside of the same universe which I am living inside of according to each of those individual human selves simultaneously)) to be living inside of disappears (along with my physical body) while I am sleeping. Based on recent empirical evidence which I accidentally gleaned from sleeping outside and on hiking trails (because the trails were drier than the moist dew-strung grass and dirt), humans other than myself have allegedly seen me lying on the ground motionless and soundless and even claimed to be worried that I was dead or comatose. Such data (though not conclusive to 100% verify that the scenario I posited earlier in this paragraph is true or false) seems to support the proposition that my physical body remains in its encompassing universe even if my mind appears to itself to be elsewhere. </p>
<p>If someone kills me while I am asleep and dreaming, I assume that my dreams would cease along with any other phenomena which are present in my consciousness (because my current paradigm (which is not as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> panpsychic</a> as people might assume my worldview is based on what I wrote in <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) posits that my consciousness is an emergent property of underlying physical processes inside of my brain and that consciousness cannot exist independently of the particular spatially finite computational hardware which apparently substantiates that particular instance of self-aware or not-quite-self-aware (but still nevertheless aware of something) consciousness).</p>
<p>I do still cling to the hope that all the things which I posit in Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com are true and possible and that I inevitably will eventually accomplish every genuinely-important goal I set for myself to attain even if such goal-oriented procedures continue to be implemented for an infinitely long time period. If I am truly immortal and able to construct and then inhabit any dream I want to as a God (and ideally as one of limitlessly many of such Gods which each have the same degree of universe creating, universe inhabiting, and universe controlling capabilities (except from within the context of any particular individual dream instance which necessarily constrains the dreaming God&#8217;s capabilities in accordance with the physical rules by which that particular universe in that dream operates for as long as that dream endures (whether or not the dreamer can prematurely exit the dream or make runtime edits to that dream universe&#8217;s underlying mechanics at specific points along that dream&#8217;s runtime))), then I have everything I need to be happy (unless I somehow got trapped in a dream or in a series of dreams which prevent me from being able to make what I consider to be satisfactory progress towards my goals and/or from being able to know with certainty whether or not what I said in this paragraph is true). I think that, given enough time, I will eventually &#8220;win the lottery&#8221; and attain those two things I want which I mentioned in the previous sentence (and those two things are <span style="background:#00ff00">(a) making what I consider to be satisfactory progress towards my goals for an infinitely long time and (b) knowing with absolute certainty that I am one of limitlessly many Gods with the unconditional capacity to create limitlessly many universes, inhabit limitlessly many universes, and control the underlying mechanics of any universe which I create or inhabit such that I can exit that universe whenever I want to (if I am inhabiting it as a &#8220;player&#8221; of that &#8220;game&#8221;) or modify the underlying physics of that universe to my liking whenever I want to such that I am always able to get out of logical fallacies which I otherwise would be trapped inside of</span>).</p>
