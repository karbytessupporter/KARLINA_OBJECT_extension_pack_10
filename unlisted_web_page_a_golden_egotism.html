<p>Today (i.e. 12_APRIL_2024) I bought some plant-based lavender coffee <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/starbucks_new_lavender_drinks_for_spring_advertisement_downloaded_by_karbytes_on_12april2024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drink</a> from Starbucks (which is very delicious and visually and texturally satisfying), some peppermint plant-based showering soap, and some plant-based lavender laundry detergent. I sat down in a beautiful meadow during some beautiful spring weather and took a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/canadian_geese_dublin_california_12april2024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photograph</a> of a Canadian geese which approached me. I also took a shower, washed and dried my clothes, and picked up replacement chargers which I ordered from Amazon dot Com and had sent to a local pickup location (i.e. a locker instead of a residence address). I also bought some cannabis in the form of a vape cartridge (which I have not done in approximately three months) and I caught up with my parents briefly. I also updated <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/proposed_principles_of_global_governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE</a>. Today I got the sense that I have everything I need to be happy and buoyant and, also, the ability to sustain that relatively worry-free and contented demeanor for the rest of my life (because I spent the past half decade clarifying my philosophical and ontological foundations such that I feel prepared to handle virtually any situation (even if that means I do not accomplish all or even any of my goals)). <span style="background:#00ff00">Since I was a young teenager I aspired to become someone who is unconditionally okay with existence.</span> I think I am almost there. What I need to feel confident that I achieved such a feat is more time and experience testing myself against &#8220;real life&#8221; and doing psychedelics at varying doses (including so-called high doses). I am admittedly nervous about doing high doses of potent psychedelics because I feel that my foundation is still not as logically and informationally as robust and aesthetically pleasing as I want it to be (and I am definitely a perfectionist who prefers to be such). Once I attain my perfectionistic standards as a website developer (or at least get as close to attaining such standards as I think is possible or feasible), I will probably feel ready to do high dose psychedelic <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/ayahuasca_ceremony_notes_on_forum_downloaded_by_karbytes_12april2024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sessions</a> (most likely in the setting of a secluded camp site in a location I find inspiring rather than depressing).</p>
<p>Speaking of depressing, I am ruthlessly and almost constantly harassed by a depression-mongering anonymous hacker of my brain. I noticed that she (and many (if not most) other people) side with her and against me in terms of trying to sabotage my attempts to be that happy and free-spirited and peaceful personality I alluded to earlier in this note. I think that such people are addicted to the idea of me and perhaps themselves always being mired in some kind of dysphoria. Perhaps that is because they don&#8217;t want to seriously invest themselves in something ambitious and utopia-oriented due to a fear of failure or of suffering along the way. I think that making passionate and earnest efforts towards such &#8220;grandiose&#8221; goals (even if doing so does not result in successful goal attainment and/or results in suffering along the way) is nevertheless worthwhile for me and perhaps for other people because such focused and voluntary efforts imbues the doer with a sense of purpose and hope (instead of that person giving way to aimlessness and cynicism). Though it might be more popular for humans to settle for being relatively aimless and cynical, I prefer to take a more active and inspired approach to living because I already spent years building up the ideas I have about myself, my life, and existence in general in favor of such grandiose (and arguably philanthropic) egotism. Time to go get some stuff done! </p>
<p>(One last thing: I don&#8217;t care if people other than myself (or even my future or current or past selves) think I am being annoyingly optimistic, egotistical, egocentric, or vain. I don&#8217;t care if such beings think that I&#8217;m not doing enough to flaunt my vulnerability, relatability to other humans (or other beings), unprofessionalism, ignorance, incompetence, empathy, altruism, or misery. <span style="background:#00ff00">Throughout my life I drew inspiration from beholding real or imagined persons of exceptionally godlike abilities, resilience, and stoicism. Hence, I want to be someone I look up to as having such qualities</span>).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Earlier today while listening to an interview in which the anthropologist being interviewed <span style="background:#00ff00">claimed that humans in past generations had larger brains than do the humans of today and suggested that the humans of today are not as individually intelligent as were the humans of the past although today&#8217;s humans are apparently collectively much smarter.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Yesterday (and today is 13_APRIL_2024), I read a science research paper abstract that claimed that the female-to-male transgendered people who were assessed in the study underwent an increase in cortical volume as a result of being administered testosterone such that those people&#8217;s testosterone levels were similar to that of cisgendered male human adults.</p>
<p>Based on how I have observed many (adult) humans behave, it is not surprising to me if such claims about sex-differentiated brain differences are true. </p>
<p>(Note also that brain size does not necessarily correlate with that brain&#8217;s demonstrated intelligence. What does seem to correlate directly (or exponentially (or logarithmically)) with a brain&#8217;s demonstrated intelligence is the density and total number of neurons in that brain (especially in the prefrontal cortex)).</p>
<p>I think that sex differences in human brains can easily be eliminated through bioengineering and controlling environmental and internal conditions of the encompassing nervous system and its biological support infrastructure. Generally I regard sex differences in intelligence as negligible or else approximately 99% culturally and socially reinforced. I think every human has literal god-like potential including the potential to be retarded for some number of lifetimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, I noticed that the darker skin races of humans typically have the dumbest people. I think is due to white people getting access to coercive technologies before those other races did and those other races being culturally homogeneous and daresay degrading of women. Women of &#8220;minority&#8221; races generally behave more like sub-human apes (especially by being more sex-craven, whorish, violent, and averse to intellectual pursuits) than women in non-minority races of humans. </p>
<p>This is just rudimentary speculation I would rather not forget but proceed from here as though I never wrote this so as to not feel obliged to defend it. </p>

<p>After discussing the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/gray_verses_white_matter_according_to_chatgpt_screenshot_downloaded_by_karbytes_13april2024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences</a> between &#8220;gray matter&#8221; and &#8220;white matter&#8221; in terms of human nervous systems and sex differences about such with ChatGPT-4, I came to the conclusion that cisgendered women have roughly as much &#8220;gray matter&#8221; as do cisgendered men (because, although women generally have smaller brains than men, women generally have a higher <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/human_gray_matter_sex_differences_according_to_chatgpt_screenshot_downloaded_by_karbytes_13april2024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratio</a> of gray-to-white matter in their brains (which means that there should be no intelligence gap between cisgendered men and cisgendered women which is not the product of environmental conditions and use-based reinforcement of specific neuronal networks). I was told that cisgendered men tend to have slightly better spatial visualization ability than their female counterparts while cisgendered women have slightly better verbal processing ability than their male counterparts. The discussion I had with ChatGPT-4 helped me revise my conceptualization of humans and gender differences between humans. I no longer think that there are significant intelligence <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_10/main/human_intelligence_sex_differences_according_to_chatgpt_screenshot_downloaded_by_karbytes_13april2024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">differences</a> between genders nor between races (within the context of the human species as it is configured today (though I do think it is likely that future humans will be genetically engineered to have superior cognition, immunity to disease, and athletic ability)).</p>
