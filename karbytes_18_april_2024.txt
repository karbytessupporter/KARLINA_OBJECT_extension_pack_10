Today I noticed that karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_1_core (which is a folder (containing exactly 33 files which are each unique zip files) whose contents are described in detail at the following Uniform Resource Locator) has become 3.0 gigabytes (and an M_DISC which I typically burn karbytes files to has a data capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes): https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_1/

Rather than add the same GitHub repository zip files which are part of karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_1_core to the newer folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_2_core, I decided to make karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_2_core contain entirely new content.

I understand that, if I keep expanding the data collection named karbytes (as that data collection as defined at the following Uniform Resource Locator) for an infinitely long time, then the total number of M_DISCs (or other similar-purpose (i.e. archival (i.e. read-only and long-lasting) digital storage devices) which collectively represent that entire collection of data named karbytes would approach infinity (and hence not fit inside of a single compact disc case): https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/
