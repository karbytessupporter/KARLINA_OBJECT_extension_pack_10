<p>karbytes used the following prompt text along with uploading the aforementioned image: <strong style="color:#0f541b"><em>Transcribe the text in the uploaded image.</em></strong></p>
<p>The following text was output by ChatGPT-4 as a result of karbytes inputting the aforementioned prompt and image upload:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">The text in the image reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">ChatGPT 4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">In the context of quantum computing and quantum entanglement of ions (et cetera), is instantaneous transmission of digital (or analog) information possible?</span></p>
<p><em>(ChatGPT output a horizontal line).</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">ChatGPT</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">In the context of quantum computing and quantum entanglement, the concept of using entangled particles such as ions to achieve instantaneous transmission of digital or analog information is intriguing but fundamentally misconstrued due to the principles of quantum mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where pairs or groups of particles interact in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. However, this entanglement does not allow for the direct transmission of information at speeds faster than light or instantaneously in a way that would violate the principles of relativity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">The key limitation here is related to the &#8220;no-communication theorem&#8221; in quantum mechanics. This theorem essentially states that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit any usable information between entangled parties without a classical communication channel, which is limited by the speed of light. When a measurement is made on one entangled particle, the state of the other particle is instantaneously determined, but this outcome is random. Consequently, the result on one side cannot be controlled in a way that would convey specific information to the observer of the other particle without additional classical information being sent to compare results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">Thus, while quantum entanglement can lead to correlations that are confirmed instantly upon measurement, it does not enable the actual transmission of information (digital or analog) instantaneously or faster than light. The transmission of any specific, meaningful information still relies on classical communication methods, adhering to the speed limits set by the theory of relativity.</span></p>
